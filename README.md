# Borewell Motor Monitoring and Overcoming Motor Failure Using Internet of Things
## Introduction
Groundwater is the mainstay of irrigated agriculture in India. As agriculture cannot flourish without judicious use of water, most of the farmers in India use groundwater irrigation. But when underground water is not available, the motor pumps which depend on groundwater run dry and thus get damaged. This causes huge loss to the farmer as it takes few months to get the motor repaired. As the crop lacks irrigation facility during this period, it withers thus causing the farmerâ€™s effort to go vain.
